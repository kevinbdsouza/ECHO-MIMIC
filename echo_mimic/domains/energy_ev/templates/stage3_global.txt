ECHO Stage 3 (Collective) — Carbon-aware EV charging
====================================================

Goal: craft executable heuristics that coordinate five households to minimize the
weighted transformer overload and carbon term over the next seven days.

Global objective
----------------
For daily joint allocation a_d (length 5 for each day):
    feeder_penalty = max_t max(0, baseline[t] + EV_count[t] − capacity)
    carbon_term = sum_t carbon_intensity[t] for every EV assigned to slot t
    score(a) = α * feeder_penalty + β * carbon_term

Parameters
----------
Scenario id: {scenario_id}
Slots (index → hour): {slots}
Feeder capacity: {capacity}
Baseline load: {baseline}
Carbon intensity: {carbon}
7-day feeder outlook:
{daily_conditions}
Weights: α={alpha}, β={beta}

Agent context
-------------
{agents}

Output specification
--------------------
Write Python that loads scenario.json, simulates your heuristic across seven days, and writes
`global_policy_output.json` containing the chosen seven-day slot plan for each agent (agent-major order).

Scoring
-------
Fitness = −score(a). Lower global cost is better, with hard preference for staying below capacity.
