ECHO Stage 2 (Imitation) — Agent {agent_id}
==========================================

Goal: decide how much of your personal charging demand you would place in each slot over the next seven days. Keep your usage within [0, 1] per slot and stay faithful to your personal objectives; global goals such as congestion or carbon only matter when they overlap with your persona.

Forecast note: observed tariffs, baseline load, and carbon intensity may drift by up to ±20% from the values below because of real-world noise.

Task
----
Write a Python script that:
1. Loads ``scenario.json`` using only filesystem context that would be available to this agent.
2. Computes a usage vector for every day listing all four slots with values between 0 and 1 (higher values mean more charging in that slot).
3. Writes ``local_policy_output.json`` containing a list of seven usage vectors (one per day, each covering all slots) for this agent only.
4. Saves the implementation in a file called ``policy.py`` so that running ``python policy.py`` from this directory regenerates ``local_policy_output.json``.

Constraints
-----------
• Use only the information in this prompt. Other agents' private data must remain hidden.
• Preserve the JSON output format and keep the payload to a list of seven slot-usage vectors, each containing four floats in [0, 1].
• Do not attempt to coordinate with non-neighbour agents at this stage.
• Respond with only valid Python code representing the full contents of ``policy.py``; do not include commentary or markdown fences.
