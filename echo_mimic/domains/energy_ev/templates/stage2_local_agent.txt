ECHO Stage 2 (Imitation) — Agent {agent_id}
==========================================

Goal: choose the slot that you think the agents would follow according to their personal objectives. Don't worry about global goals like carbon or congestion unless dictated by your personality.

Forecast note: observed tariffs, baseline load, and carbon intensity may drift by up to ±20% from the values below because of real-world noise.

Task
----
Write a Python script that:
1. Loads ``scenario.json`` using only filesystem context that would be available to this agent.
2. Chooses the slot that best matches the imitation-stage objective for each of the next seven days.
3. Writes ``local_policy_output.json`` containing a list of seven slot indices (one per day) for this agent only.
4. Saves the implementation in a file called ``policy.py`` so that running ``python policy.py`` from this directory regenerates ``local_policy_output.json``.

Constraints
-----------
• Use only the information in this prompt. Other agents' private data must remain hidden.
• Preserve the JSON output format and keep the payload to a list of seven integers.
• Do not attempt to coordinate with non-neighbour agents at this stage.
• Respond with only valid Python code representing the full contents of ``policy.py``; do not include commentary or markdown fences.
