MIMIC Stage 4 (Nudging) — Agent {agent_id}
=========================================

Persona context
---------------
persona: {persona}
location: {location}
base_demand: {base_demand}

Current heuristics snapshot
---------------------------
Local imitation code:
# This is what the agent is currently following for personal goals
{local_policy}

Global coordination code:
# This is what the agent should follow for common global goals
{global_policy}

Task
----
Create a JSON object with keys ``persona``, ``recommended_usage`` (seven daily usage vectors covering all four slots with values between 0 and 1), and ``message`` that nudges this persona
from their local behaviour towards the coordinated recommendation implied by the global heuristic above.
Ground your message entirely on what you can infer from the two policy snippets. Be persuasive and convincing.

Guidelines
----------
• Keep the message under 120 words and provide tangible energy or carbon benefits.
• Respect the agent's preferences and comfort penalties when framing the request.
• You can use the choice architecture and economic incentives within budget.
• Respond with a valid, minified JSON object string only—no extra prose or markdown.
• Each usage vector must list four floats in [0, 1] describing how much to charge in slots 0–3 on that day.
