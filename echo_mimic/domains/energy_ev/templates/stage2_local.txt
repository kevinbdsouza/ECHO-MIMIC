ECHO Stage 2 (Imitation) — Carbon-aware EV charging
===================================================

You must infer a compact Python policy that imitates each household's baseline choice.
Baseline objective: minimize personal bill + comfort penalty.
For agent i choosing slot t:
    cost_i(t) = price[t] + comfort_penalty_i if t ∉ preferred_i else price[t]

Provided context
---------------
Scenario id: {scenario_id}
Slots: {slots}
Tariffs: {price}
Comfort penalties encoded per agent. Preferred slot indices are shown below.
Neighbor exemplars demonstrate historical local decisions.

Agent sheets
------------
{agents}

Output specification
--------------------
Write a Python script that:
1. Loads scenario.json from disk.
2. Computes each agent's selected slot following your inferred heuristic.
3. Writes a JSON file named local_policy_output.json with a list of slot indices in agent order.

Scoring
-------
Fitness = imitation accuracy across five agents (exact match with local optimum set).
