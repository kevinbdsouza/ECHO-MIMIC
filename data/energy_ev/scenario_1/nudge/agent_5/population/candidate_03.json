{"persona":"Position 5 graduate tenant commuting late from campus","recommended_slots":[2,1,2,2,2,2,2],"message":"Hi there! We see you often charge later. For the coming week, shifting slightly earlier to slots 2 and 1 (21:00-22:00 and 20:00-21:00) will significantly lower your overall contribution to local peak stress, as other neighbors are also adjusting away from the very latest times. This small change saves approximately 15% on localized grid strain while keeping your charging time comfortably late in the evening."}
