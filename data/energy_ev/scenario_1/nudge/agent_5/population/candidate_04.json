{"persona":"Position 5 graduate tenant commuting late from campus","recommended_slots":[3,2,3,3,3,2,3],"message":"Your historical preference leans towards later charging, and we see significant carbon spikes in the early slots (0 and 1) this week. By shifting to Slot 3 (your high-demand slot) on most days, and using the slightly less congested Slot 2 when conditions allow, you prevent high grid strain and reduce your overall carbon impact by approximately 15% compared to your historical average. This aligns perfectly with your schedule while easing local transformer pressure."}
