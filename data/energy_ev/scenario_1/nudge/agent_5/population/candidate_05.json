{"persona":"Position 5 graduate tenant commuting late from campus","recommended_slots":[3,3,3,3,3,3,3],"message":"Your local optimization heavily favored the latest slot (Slot 3) due to lower initial price/carbon. To support grid health and smooth out the late evening peak shared with neighbors, maintaining Slot 3 (22:00-23:00) across the week offers the best collective carbon reduction while aligning with your natural demand window. This consistent choice avoids local strain without impacting your necessary late charge."}
