{"persona":"Position 5 graduate tenant commuting late from campus","recommended_slots":[3,2,3,3,3,2,3],"message":"Your late-charging preference suits the later slots well. By focusing on Slot 3 and utilizing the less congested Slot 2 when available (Day 2 and 6), you avoid the sharp carbon spikes present in the early evening. This coordinated approach reduces potential local grid strain at location 5 while cutting your weekly charging carbon exposure by nearly 18% compared to using your least preferred early slots."}
