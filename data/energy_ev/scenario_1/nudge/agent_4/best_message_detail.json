  "message": "As retirees prioritizing comfort, your high base demand in Slot 0 (19-20h) is noted. However, coordinate with neighbors today and tomorrow by shifting slightly away from Slot 0 to Slot 3 on Day 4. This small adjustment minimizes grid warnings (spatial carbon) while maintaining high comfort focus, saving about 15% on combined operational costs across the week compared to staying strictly local.",
