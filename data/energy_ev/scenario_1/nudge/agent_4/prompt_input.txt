MIMIC Stage 4 (Nudging) — Agent 4
=========================================

Persona context
---------------
Retired couple monitoring comfort and bills

Neighbour exemplars (still the only observations available)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Neighbor 3 → slot 2 (Central neighbor anchors on 21-22h to keep routine)
- Neighbor 5 → slot 3 (Downstream neighbor also favors final slot when peak warning issued)

Current heuristics snapshot
---------------------------
Local imitation code:
    # Local policy for agent 4 not yet evolved

Global coordination code:
    # Global policy for agent 4 not yet evolved

Task
----
Create a JSON object with keys ``persona``, ``recommended_slot``, and ``message`` that nudges this persona
from their local behaviour towards the coordinated recommendation implied by the global heuristic above.
Ground your message entirely on what you can infer from the two policy snippets and the limited neighbour context.

Guidelines
----------
• Keep the message under 120 words and provide tangible energy or carbon benefits.
• Respect the agent's preferences and comfort penalties when framing the request.
• Do not reference agents or information outside the neighbourhood evidence shown.
