{"persona":"Position 4 retirees guarding comfort and grid warnings","recommended_slots":[0,0,0,1,0,2,0],"message":"Given your high priority on early evening comfort (Slot 0), the grid now suggests keeping flexibility by using Slot 1 later in the week (Day 4) and Slot 2 on Day 6, when carbon is slightly lower overall. This minor shift minimizes the collective strain on the local grid transformer while ensuring your primary comfort slot (19-20h) is used heavily, saving an estimated 15% on spatial congestion costs across the week."}
