{"persona":"Position 4 retirees guarding comfort and grid warnings","recommended_slots":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"message":"We recognize your priority is comfort, especially in Slot 0 (19-20h). Grid warnings suggest carbon is high late afternoon. For Days 1-7, sustaining your preferred Slot 0 aligns best with low neighbor interference and avoids the dirtiest late-evening carbon spikes observed city-wide. This strategy keeps your comfort high while marginally improving the overall grid response."}
