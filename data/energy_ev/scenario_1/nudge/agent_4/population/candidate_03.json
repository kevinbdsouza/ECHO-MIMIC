{"persona":"Position 4 retirees guarding comfort and grid warnings","recommended_slots":[1,1,0,1,1,0,1],"message":"Hello neighbors. To ease transformer stress highlighted by local warnings (especially on Day 6), we see alignment is beneficial. Your strong comfort preference remains respected, but coordinating away from Slot 0 on Days 2, 6, and 7 towards Slot 1 (which often aligns with lower spatial congestion) balances comfort and grid health. This coordinated shift saves approximately 50-70g/kWh in spatial carbon across those days while maintaining your primary comfort period usage."}
