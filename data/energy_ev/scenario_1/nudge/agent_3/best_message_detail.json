  "message": "To maximize grid health and leverage better spatial carbon conditions, try shifting your primary charging session to Slot 1 (20:00-21:00) every day. While Slot 2 aligns with your peak internal demand, Slot 1 offers lower immediate congestion, especially when neighbors are active. This consistent Slot 1 usage mirrors observed efficient neighbor behavior and helps stabilize local transformer load.",
