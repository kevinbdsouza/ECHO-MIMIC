MIMIC Stage 4 (Nudging) — Agent 3
=========================================

Persona context
---------------
Position 3 night-shift nurse on the central ridge

Neighbour exemplars (still the only observations available)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Neighbor 2 → slot 2 (Analyst stayed on slot 2 when feeder stress stayed low)
- Neighbor 5 → slot 1 (Student tenant mirrored the ridge plan to align with transit)

Current heuristics snapshot
---------------------------
Local imitation code:
    # Local policy for agent 3 not yet evolved

Global coordination code:
    # Global policy for agent 3 not yet evolved

Task
----
Create a JSON object with keys ``persona``, ``recommended_slots`` (seven daily indices), and ``message`` that nudges this persona
from their local behaviour towards the coordinated recommendation implied by the global heuristic above.
Ground your message entirely on what you can infer from the two policy snippets and the limited neighbour context.

Guidelines
----------
• Keep the message under 120 words and provide tangible energy or carbon benefits.
• Respect the agent's preferences and comfort penalties when framing the request.
• Do not reference agents or information outside the neighbourhood evidence shown.
• Respond with a valid, minified JSON object string only—no extra prose or markdown.
