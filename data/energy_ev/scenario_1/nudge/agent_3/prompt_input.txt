MIMIC Stage 4 (Nudging) — Agent 3
=========================================

Persona context
---------------
Night-shift nurse who values rest and reliability

Neighbour exemplars (still the only observations available)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Neighbor 2 → slot 1 (Upstream neighbor leans on 20-21h when feeder is loose)
- Neighbor 4 → slot 3 (Downstream neighbor absorbs late slot to dodge carbon)

Current heuristics snapshot
---------------------------
Local imitation code:
    # Local policy for agent 3 not yet evolved

Global coordination code:
    # Global policy for agent 3 not yet evolved

Task
----
Create a JSON object with keys ``persona``, ``recommended_slot``, and ``message`` that nudges this persona
from their local behaviour towards the coordinated recommendation implied by the global heuristic above.
Ground your message entirely on what you can infer from the two policy snippets and the limited neighbour context.

Guidelines
----------
• Keep the message under 120 words and provide tangible energy or carbon benefits.
• Respect the agent's preferences and comfort penalties when framing the request.
• Do not reference agents or information outside the neighbourhood evidence shown.
