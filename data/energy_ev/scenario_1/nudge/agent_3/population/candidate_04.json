{"persona":"Position 3 night-shift nurse on the central ridge","recommended_slots":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],"message":"As a night-shift nurse, your high demand peaks align perfectly with slots 1 (20:00-21:00) and 2. While your local imitation favored a neighbor's fixed schedule, coordinating charging to Slot 1 every day significantly reduces strain on the local grid, offering better collective stability. This shift aligns with your highest base demand (0.80) and avoids the penalties incurred by charging too early or too late."}
