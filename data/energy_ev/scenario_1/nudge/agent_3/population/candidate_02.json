{"persona":"Position 3 night-shift nurse on the central ridge","recommended_slots":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],"message":"Your night-shift schedule strongly favors slots 1 (20:00-21:00) and 2. To support local grid stability, we highly recommend charging exclusively in Slot 1 (20:00-21:00) this week. This choice aligns with grid stability goals while perfectly matching your core operational window, minimizing comfort penalties compared to shifting to Slot 0 or 3."}
