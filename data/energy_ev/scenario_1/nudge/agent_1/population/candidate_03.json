{"persona":"Position 1 battery engineer balancing budget and solar backfeed","recommended_slots":[1,1,1,2,1,1,1],"message":"To optimize your budget while respecting localized solar constraints, shift activity slightly towards Slot 1 (20-21h) for Days 3, 4, and 6. This aligns with common neighbor behavior (especially N3), minimizing conflicts with the transformer analyst (N2) during their critical Day 4 staggered use. This small adjustment should improve your overall energy score by reducing spatial carbon impacts without significantly raising your immediate tariff cost."}
