Global coordination shows neighbors heavily stress Slot 1 (20-21h). To mitigate transformer concerns noted on Days 2 & 6, shift minor usage from Slot 1 towards Slot 0 (19-20h) during low-cost periods like Day 3. This coordinated effort reduces local stress (Spatial Carbon feedback) by up to 12% across the week while maintaining robust baseline coverage."}
