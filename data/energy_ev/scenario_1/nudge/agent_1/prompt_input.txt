MIMIC Stage 4 (Nudging) — Agent 1
=========================================

Persona context
---------------
Budget-sensitive engineer with a solar-equipped townhouse

Neighbour exemplars (still the only observations available)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Neighbor 2 → slot 1 (Neighbor moved earlier to ride lower price despite mild carbon bump)
- Neighbor 2 → slot 0 (On feeder warning day neighbor took earliest slot to protect 21-22h peak)

Current heuristics snapshot
---------------------------
Local imitation code:
    # Local policy for agent 1 not yet evolved

Global coordination code:
    # Global policy for agent 1 not yet evolved

Task
----
Create a JSON object with keys ``persona``, ``recommended_slot``, and ``message`` that nudges this persona
from their local behaviour towards the coordinated recommendation implied by the global heuristic above.
Ground your message entirely on what you can infer from the two policy snippets and the limited neighbour context.

Guidelines
----------
• Keep the message under 120 words and provide tangible energy or carbon benefits.
• Respect the agent's preferences and comfort penalties when framing the request.
• Do not reference agents or information outside the neighbourhood evidence shown.
