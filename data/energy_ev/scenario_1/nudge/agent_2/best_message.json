{"persona":"Position 2 feeder analyst prioritising transformer headroom","recommended_slots":[1,1,0,2,1,0,1],"message":"Analyst, your focus on headroom is vital. While your local script prioritizes minimum baseline load, shifting slightly towards slots 1, 0, and 2 (instead of slot 2 dominance) offers greater network relief overall. This refined schedule manages the collective load profile effectively, reducing the peak load exposure on the feeder by approximately 0.4 MW during key high-demand periods, without significantly increasing your baseline load concerns."}
