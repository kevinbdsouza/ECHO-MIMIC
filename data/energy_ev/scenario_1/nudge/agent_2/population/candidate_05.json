{"persona":"Position 2 feeder analyst prioritising transformer headroom","recommended_slots":[2,2,1,0,2,2,2],"message":"Analyst, your local priority for transformer headroom is noted. To ensure feeder stability across the week while marginally improving spatial carbon metrics, please align with the recommended schedule: [2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]. This pattern respects your preference for lower baseline load slots (like Slot 2) but strategically shifts to Slot 0 on Day 4 where it significantly reduces local carbon intensity (by ~175 points vs. your preferred choice), without stressing feeder capacity above baseline."}
