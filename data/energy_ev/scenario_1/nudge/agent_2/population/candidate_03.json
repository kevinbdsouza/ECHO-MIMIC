{"persona":"Position 2 feeder analyst prioritising transformer headroom","recommended_slots":[2,2,2,2,2,2,2],"message":"Analyst, your focus on transformer headroom is vital. While your local logic targets low baseline load (Day 4 target was slot 0 due to price tie-break), grid coordination shows slot 2 minimizes overall system cost (a proxy for avoiding localized stress). Adopting slot 2 consistently across all 7 days keeps your location load stable and below critical thresholds, yielding significant congestion cost savings (GAMMA weight in coordination). This alignment ensures local equipment safety while contributing to grid efficiency."}
