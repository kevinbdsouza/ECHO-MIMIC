{"persona":"Position 2 feeder analyst prioritising transformer headroom","recommended_slots":[2,2,2,0,2,2,2],"message":"Analyst, prioritizing feeder headroom is crucial. While your internal model favors low baseline load (suggesting [2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]), global coordination shows that slots 1 and 3 on Days 3 and 4 present opportunities to balance load effectively. Shifting slightly to Slot 2 on Day 3 (instead of Slot 1) and Slot 0 on Day 4 (as planned) maintains high safety margins. Following this coordinated pattern (Slot 2 on Day 3, Slot 0 on Day 4) keeps your peak load exposure extremely low, potentially saving over 0.5 units of capacity stress across the week compared to randomized choices."}
