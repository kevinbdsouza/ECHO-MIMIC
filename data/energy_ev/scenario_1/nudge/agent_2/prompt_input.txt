MIMIC Stage 4 (Nudging) — Agent 2
=========================================

Persona context
---------------
Position 2 feeder analyst prioritising transformer headroom

Neighbour exemplars (still the only observations available)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Neighbor 1 → slot 0 (Battery neighbor grabbed slot 0 when slot 2 hit its max)
- Neighbor 4 → slot 3 (Position 4 retirees shifted to slot 3 when carbon spiked upstream)

Current heuristics snapshot
---------------------------
Local imitation code:
    # Local policy for agent 2 not yet evolved

Global coordination code:
    # Global policy for agent 2 not yet evolved

Task
----
Create a JSON object with keys ``persona``, ``recommended_slots`` (seven daily indices), and ``message`` that nudges this persona
from their local behaviour towards the coordinated recommendation implied by the global heuristic above.
Ground your message entirely on what you can infer from the two policy snippets and the limited neighbour context.

Guidelines
----------
• Keep the message under 120 words and provide tangible energy or carbon benefits.
• Respect the agent's preferences and comfort penalties when framing the request.
• Do not reference agents or information outside the neighbourhood evidence shown.
• Respond with a valid, minified JSON object string only—no extra prose or markdown.
