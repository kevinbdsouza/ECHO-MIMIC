  Day 7 (Day 7 — Cool front lowers late-night load)
    Tariff: 0.25, 0.18, 0.23, 0.20
    Carbon: 520, 460, 480, 390
    Baseline load: 5.0, 5.4, 5.1, 6.3
Global weights α=40.00, β=0.50

Agent roster (ordered along the feeder)
--------------------------------------
Agent 1 (Budget-sensitive engineer with a solar-equipped townhouse)
  Base demand: [1.1, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6]
  Preferred slots: [1, 3]
  Comfort penalty: 0.16
  Neighbor ICL:
    - Example with neighbor 2: slot 1 (Neighbor moved earlier to ride lower price despite mild carbon bump)
    - Example with neighbor 2: slot 0 (On feeder warning day neighbor took earliest slot to protect 21-22h peak)

Agent 2 (Grid analyst who cares about transformer life)
  Base demand: [0.6, 1.0, 0.7, 0.5]
  Preferred slots: [0, 1]
  Comfort penalty: 0.12
  Neighbor ICL:
    - Example with neighbor 1: slot 1 (Neighbor slides to 20-21h when price gap widens)
    - Example with neighbor 3: slot 2 (Central neighbor sticks to 21-22h unless carbon spikes)

Agent 3 (Night-shift nurse who values rest and reliability)
  Base demand: [0.7, 0.9, 0.8, 0.6]
  Preferred slots: [2]
  Comfort penalty: 0.22
  Neighbor ICL:
    - Example with neighbor 2: slot 1 (Upstream neighbor leans on 20-21h when feeder is loose)
    - Example with neighbor 4: slot 3 (Downstream neighbor absorbs late slot to dodge carbon)

Agent 4 (Retired couple monitoring comfort and bills)
  Base demand: [0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.9]
  Preferred slots: [3]
  Comfort penalty: 0.16
  Neighbor ICL:
    - Example with neighbor 3: slot 2 (Central neighbor anchors on 21-22h to keep routine)
    - Example with neighbor 5: slot 3 (Downstream neighbor also favors final slot when peak warning issued)

Agent 5 (Student tenant juggling late classes)
  Base demand: [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8]
  Preferred slots: [3]
  Comfort penalty: 0.1
  Neighbor ICL:
    - Example with neighbor 4: slot 3 (Upstream neighbor usually sits at 22-23h unless feeder alarms)
    - Example with neighbor 4: slot 2 (On price spike nights upstream shifts to 21-22h to dodge carbon)

Task framing
------------
• Each household charges exactly one normalized EV unit per day in a single slot.
• Neighboring context is communicated using short in-context exemplars.
• The pipeline provides the four-stage ECHO-MIMIC workflow for this energy domain.
