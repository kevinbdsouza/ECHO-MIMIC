ECHO Stage 2 (Imitation) — Agent 3
==========================================

Scenario id: ev_peak_sharing_1
Slots (index → hour): 0: 19-20, 1: 20-21, 2: 21-22, 3: 22-23
Retail tariff ($/kWh): 0.28, 0.19, 0.26, 0.22
Grid carbon intensity (gCO2/kWh): 560, 500, 520, 420
Feeder capacity (kW equivalent): 7.0
Baseline non-EV load (kW): 5.2, 5.6, 5.0, 6.7

Your profile
------------
Persona: Night-shift nurse who values rest and reliability
Base demand per slot: 0.70, 0.90, 0.80, 0.60
Preferred slots: 2
Comfort penalty when deviating: 0.22

Observed neighbour exemplars
----------------------------
- Neighbor 2 → slot 1 (Upstream neighbor leans on 20-21h when feeder is loose)
- Neighbor 4 → slot 3 (Downstream neighbor absorbs late slot to dodge carbon)

Task
----
Write a Python script that:
1. Loads ``scenario.json`` using only filesystem context that would be available to this agent.
2. Chooses the slot that best matches the imitation-stage objective described in the agent sheet.
3. Writes ``local_policy_output.json`` containing the chosen slot index for this agent only.

Constraints
-----------
• Use only the information in this prompt. Other agents' private data must remain hidden.
• Preserve the JSON output format and keep the payload to a single integer value.
• Do not attempt to coordinate with non-neighbour agents at this stage.
